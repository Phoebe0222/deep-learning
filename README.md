Deep Learning
======
This includes my notes for studying deep learning course from deeplearning.ai and other sources. Notes and codes will be uploaded bit by bit as I learn through the course. 

lesson 1: Neural Network and Deep Learning
------

The general methodology to build a Neural Network is to:

1. Define the neural network structure:
	- how many input/output units
 	- whether shallow or deep NN (i.e. # of hidden units)
 	- which activation functions to use
2. Initialize the model's parameters
3. Loop:
    - Implement forward propagation
    - Compute loss
    - Implement backward propagation to get the gradients
    - Update parameters using gradient descent
    
The following lessons notes will cover how I learn these steps:     
- 1.1 Introduction to deep learning
- 1.2 Neural networks basics (notes on Vectorization)
- 1.3 Shallow neural networks
- 1.4 Deep neural networks 
	
lesson 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

lesson 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
------

lesson 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
------

lesson 5: Natural Language Processing: Building Sequence Models

Note that these notes only include materials from lectures.
