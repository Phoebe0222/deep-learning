Deep Learning
======
This includes my notes for studying deep learning course from deeplearning.ai and other sources. Notes and codes will be uploaded bit by bit as I learn through the course. 

lesson 1: Neural Network and Deep Learning
------

The general methodology to build a Neural Network is to:

1. Define the neural network structure:
	- how many input/output units
 	- whether shallow or deep NN (i.e. # of hidden units)
 	- which activation functions, learning rates etc. to use
2. Initialize the model's parameters
3. Loop:
    - Implement forward propagation
    - Compute loss
    - Implement backward propagation to get the gradients
    - Update parameters using gradient descent
    
The following lessons notes will cover how I learn these steps:     
- 1.1 [Introduction to deep learning](https://github.com/Phoebe0222/deep-learning/blob/master/lesson1/Lesson1-1-Intro-to-Neural-Network.pdf)
- 1.2 [Neural networks basics](https://github.com/Phoebe0222/deep-learning/blob/master/lesson1/Lesson1-2-neural-network-basics.pdf) ([notes on Vectorization](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Phoebe0222/deep-learning/blob/master/lesson1/vectorization_and_Broadcasting.ipynb))
- 1.3 [Shallow neural networks](https://github.com/Phoebe0222/deep-learning/blob/master/lesson1/Lesson1-3-shallow-neural-network.pdf)
- 1.4 [Deep neural networks](https://github.com/Phoebe0222/deep-learning/blob/master/lesson1/Lesson1-4-deep-neural-network.pdf) 
	
lesson 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
------
We have covered the theoractical part of NN, but there are more practical concerns and ways to improve it when implementing it. The following lessons include methods of how to improve NNs:  
-  2.1 [Practical aspects of Deep Learning](https://github.com/Phoebe0222/deep-learning/blob/master/lesson2/Lesson2-1-practical-aspects-of-deep-learning.pdf)
-  2.2 Optimization Algorithms
-  2.3 Hyperparameter tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks 


lesson 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
------


lesson 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
------


lesson 5: Natural Language Processing: Building Sequence Models
