This includes my notes for studying deep learning course from deeplearning.ai and other sources. Notes and codes will be uploaded bit by bit as I learn through the course. 

lesson 1: Neural Network and Deep Learning
------
- 1.1 Introduction to deep learning
- 1.2 Neural networks basics (notes on Vectorization)
- 1.3 Shallow neural networks
- 1.4 Deep neural networks 
	
lesson 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
------

lesson 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
------

lesson 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
------

lesson 5: Natural Language Processing: Building Sequence Models
